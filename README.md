### 2. **Sensors and Actuators**
   - Learn to interface sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, temperature, and light sensors) with the Arduino.
   - Control actuators like motors, servos, and relays.

### 3. **Robot Control Systems**
   - Understanding the basics of robot control systems (e.g., motors, wheels).
   - Programming differential drive systems and understanding motor controllers.

### 4. **Building a Simple Robot**
   - Step-by-step guide to building a basic mobile robot.
   - Using sensors for obstacle avoidance and path following.

### 5. **Robotic Arms and Manipulators**
   - Controlling robotic arms using servos and stepper motors.
   - Building and programming robotic arms for specific tasks.

### 6. **Wireless Communication**
   - Using wireless communication modules like **Bluetooth**, **Wi-Fi**, or **RF** to control your robot remotely.
   - Connecting the robot to a smartphone or PC for control.

### 7. **Advanced Projects**
   - Building more complex robotic systems, including autonomous robots and swarm robots.
   - Integrating computer vision and machine learning to enhance the robotâ€™s capabilities.
